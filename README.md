# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It serves as a blueprint for the layout and structure, focusing on the arrangement of elements and functionality rather than colors or graphics.

## Importance of Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it:

- Helps translate abstract ideas into tangible, visual representations.
- Allows designers and stakeholders to collaborate and agree on the structure early.
- Makes it easier to identify usability issues before investing in detailed design or development.
- Saves time and resources by facilitating early feedback and changes.

Wireframes act as a foundation for the overall design and development, ensuring that the user interface meets both user needs and project goals.
